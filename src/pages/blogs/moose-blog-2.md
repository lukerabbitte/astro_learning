Moose are known for their sheer size and weight. Adult males, also called bulls, can weigh anywhere from 800 to 1,500 pounds. Their massive antlers can span up to six feet in width, making them a truly awe-inspiring sight. Female moose, or cows, are generally smaller but still impressive in their own right.

*Unique Anatomy and Adaptations*

Moose have evolved to thrive in their northern habitat.

Additionally, their humped shoulders are adapted for breaking through snow and reaching vegetation.

Organizations and individuals are working together to protect their habitats, monitor their populations, and raise awareness about responsible wildlife interactions.
