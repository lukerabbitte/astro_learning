**Geological Survey Report**

*Introduction*

The geological survey conducted in the area of interest aimed to analyze the following within the region:
- Lithological composition
- Structural geology, and
- Stratigraphic sequence

The study focused on a comprehensive examination of rock formations, mineralogy, and tectonic features to understand the geological evolution and history of the area.

*Methods and Data Collection*

Geological mapping and surveying were conducted on foot, utilizing detailed topographic maps and GPS devices for accurate positioning. Petrographic analysis of rock samples was performed through thin section examination using polarized light microscopy. Field measurements of strike, dip, and fold axis orientation were recorded for structural analysis. Aerial and satellite imagery were also employed to map larger geological features.

*Geological Setting*

The study area is characterized by a complex geological setting, primarily comprising metamorphic rocks, granitic intrusions, and sedimentary formations. The region experienced multiple tectonic events throughout its history, leading to various deformational structures, such as folds, faults, and shear zones.

*Lithological Composition*

The lithological composition predominantly consists of metasedimentary rocks, including schists, gneisses, and quartzites. The presence of banded iron formations suggests a protracted sedimentation history involving alternating periods of deposition and tectonic activity.

*Structural Geology*

Structurally, the study area exhibits a prevalent pattern of northeast-trending fold axes, indicative of regional compressive stress. High-strain zones with mylonitic fabric are observed, reflecting intense ductile deformation. Thrust faults and normal faults are also identified, demonstrating both compressional and extensional tectonic regimes.

*Stratigraphy*

The stratigraphic sequence comprises distinct layers of sedimentary rocks, metamorphic units, and intrusions. The stratigraphy indicates multiple phases of sedimentation, metamorphism, and magmatic intrusion events over geological time. Precise dating and correlation between formations are necessary for further understanding.

*Mineralogy and Economic Significance*

The mineralogical analysis revealed the presence of valuable minerals such as garnet, mica, and quartz. Additionally, primary ore minerals, including sulfides and oxides, were identified, suggesting potential economic significance in the study area. Further exploration and assessment of these resources are recommended for potential extraction.

*Conclusion*

The geological survey provided a detailed insight into the geological history, lithological composition, structural features, stratigraphic sequence, and mineralogical content within the study area. The findings offer a solid foundation for future geological studies, resource exploration, and land-use planning in this region.
